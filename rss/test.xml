referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><p> 1899 年，经济学家 Thorstein Veblen 观察到银汤匙和紧身胸衣是精英社会地位的标志。在凡勃伦现在著名的论文<em>《有闲阶级理论》</em>中，他创造了“炫耀性消费”一词来表示物质对象被炫耀为社会地位和地位指标的方式。 100 多年后，炫耀性消费仍然是当代资本主义景观的一部分，但如今，奢侈品比凡勃伦时代更容易获得。这种触手可及的奢侈品泛滥是 20 世纪大规模生产经济、生产外包给中国以及培育劳动力和材料便宜的新兴市场的结果。与此同时，我们已经看到中产阶级消费市场的到来，他们需要以更便宜的价格购买更多的物质商品。</p><p>然而，消费品的民主化使得它们作为展示地位的手段变得不那么有用了。面对日益加剧的社会不平等，富人和中产阶级都拥有精美的电视和漂亮的手提包。他们都租赁 SUV、乘坐飞机和游轮。从表面上看，这两个群体所青睐的表面上的消费对象不再存在于两个完全不同的宇宙中。</p><p>鉴于现在每个人都可以购买名牌手袋和新车，富人开始使用更多的隐性符号来表明他们的社会地位。是的，寡头和超级富豪们仍然用游艇、宾利和带门的豪宅炫耀他们的财富。但精英消费的巨大变化是由富裕的、受过教育的精英，或者我所说的“有抱负的阶层”推动的。这些新精英通过珍视知识和建立文化资本来巩固自己的地位，更不用说随之而来的消费习惯——更愿意在服务、教育和人力资本投资上花钱，而不是纯粹的物质商品。这些新的身份行为就是我所说的“低调消费”。该术语涵盖的消费者选择没有一个本质上是显而易见的或表面上是重要的，但毫无疑问，它们是排他性的。</p><p>有抱负阶层的崛起及其消费习惯在美国可能最为突出。美国消费者支出调查数据显示，自 2007 年以来，该国收入最高的 1%（年收入超过 30 万美元的人）在物质商品上的支出明显减少，而中等收入群体（年收入约 7 万美元）的支出则减少了相同，并且它们的趋势是向上的。为了避免明显的物质主义，富人在教育、退休和健康方面的投资明显增加——所有这些都是无关紧要的，但比中等收入消费者可能购买的任何手提包都要贵很多倍。收入最高的 1% 人群现在将最大比例的支出用于不显眼的消费，其中教育占了这一支出的很大一部分（占收入最高的 1% 人群家庭支出的近 6%，而中间人群的这一比例略高于 1% - 收入支出）。事实上，自 1996 年以来，收入最高的 1% 人群的教育支出增长了 3.5 倍，而同期中等收入人群的教育支出则持平。</p><p>在美国，中等收入人群和收入最高的 1% 人群在教育支出上的巨大差距尤其令人担忧，因为与物质产品不同，近几十年来教育变得越来越昂贵。因此，更需要将财政资源投入教育，以完全负担得起。根据 2003 年至 2013 年的消费者支出调查数据，大学学费价格上涨了 80%，而女性服装的成本同期仅上涨了 6%。中产阶级缺乏教育投资并不意味着缺乏优先次序，因为它表明，对于 40 至 60 岁的五分之一人群来说，教育成本太高，几乎不值得为之存钱。</p><p>虽然许多不显眼的消费非常昂贵，但它通过更便宜但同样明显的信号表现出来——从阅读<em>《</em><em>经济学人》</em>到购买牧场饲养的鸡蛋。换句话说，低调消费已经成为新精英相互传递文化资本信号的一种方式。与私立幼儿园的发票同步的是，人们应该在午餐盒中装上藜麦饼干和有机水果。人们可能会认为这些烹饪做法是现代母亲的常见例子，但只要走出美国沿海城市的中上层阶级泡沫，就会观察到截然不同的午餐袋规范，其中包括加工过的零食几乎没有水果。同样，虽然在洛杉矶、旧金山和纽约市的时间可能让人认为每个美国母亲都会母乳喂养她的孩子一年，但全国统计<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">报告显示</a>，只有 27% 的母亲实现了美国儿科学会的这一目标（在阿拉巴马州，这个数字徘徊在 11%）。</p><p>了解这些看似廉价的社会规范本身就是进入当今理想阶层的必经之路。而且这种仪式远非没有成本：订阅<em>《经济学人》</em>可能只花 100 美元，但订阅并被人看到的意识很可能是在精英社会环境和昂贵的教育机构中花费时间的反复结果本出版物并讨论其内容。</p><p>也许最重要的是，对不炫耀性消费的新投资以以前炫耀性消费无法做到的方式重现了特权。知道在当地农贸市场可以参考哪些<em>《纽约客》</em>文章或进行哪些闲聊，可以实现并展示文化资本的获取，从而提供进入社交网络的机会，这反过来又有助于为精英工作铺平道路，关键社会和专业联系，以及私立学校。简而言之，低调消费带来社会流动性。</p><p>更深刻的是，对教育、医疗保健和退休的投资对消费者的生活质量以及下一代未来的生活机会有着显着影响。与凡勃伦时代的炫耀性消费相比，今天的炫耀性消费是一种更为有害的地位消费形式。不显眼的消费——无论是母乳喂养还是教育——都是提高自己孩子生活质量和社会流动性的一种手段，而炫耀性消费本身只是目的——只是炫耀。对于今天的理想阶层来说，不显眼的消费选择可以确保和维护社会地位，即使它们不一定会显示出来。</p><p>

年的一天，一名身材魁梧的中年男子在光天化日之下抢劫了匹兹堡的两家银行。他没有戴面具或任何形式的伪装。在走出每家银行之前，他对着监控摄像头微笑。那天晚上晚些时候，警察逮捕了惊讶的麦克阿瑟·惠勒。当他们向他展示监控录像时，Wheeler 难以置信地瞪大了眼睛。 “但我喝了果汁，”他咕哝道。显然，Wheeler 认为在他的皮肤上涂抹柠檬汁会使他在录像机中隐形。毕竟柠檬汁是用作隐形墨水的，只要不靠近热源，他应该是完全隐形的。</p><p>警方得出结论，惠勒并没有发疯或吸毒——只是大错特错。</p><p>这个故事引起了康奈尔大学心理学家大卫邓宁的注意，他邀请他的研究生贾斯汀克鲁格来看看到底发生了什么。他们推断，虽然几乎每个人都对自己在各个社会和知识领域的能力持正面看法，但有些人错误地认为自己的能力比实际能力高得多。这种“信心错觉”现在被称为“邓宁-克鲁格效应”，描述了夸大自我评估的认知偏见。</p><p>为了在实验室研究这种现象，邓宁和克鲁格设计了一些巧妙的实验。在一项<a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/teaching/p7536_heurbias/p7536_readings/kruger_dunning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">研究</a>中，他们向本科生提出了一系列关于语法、逻辑和笑话的问题，然后要求每个学生估计自己的总体分数，以及他们与其他学生相比的相对排名。有趣的是，在这些认知任务中得分最低的学生总是高估了他们的表现——高估了很多。得分在后四分位数的学生估计他们的表现比其他学生的三分之二好！</p><p>这种“自信的错觉”超越了课堂，渗透到日常生活中。在后续<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">研究</a>中，邓宁和克鲁格离开实验室前往枪支靶场，在那里他们向枪支爱好者询问枪支安全性。与他们之前的发现类似，那些正确回答最少问题的人严重高估了他们对枪支的了解。然而，在事实知识之外，邓宁-克鲁格效应也可以在人们对无数其他个人能力的自我评估中观察到。如果你今天在电视上观看任何选秀节目，你会看到未能通过海选并被评委拒绝的参赛者脸上的震惊。虽然这对我们来说几乎是可笑的，但这些人真的没有意识到他们被虚幻的优越感误导了多少。</p><p>当然，人们通常会高估自己的能力。一项<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001457586900047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">研究</a>发现，80% 的司机认为自己高于平均水平——这在统计上是不可能的。当人们评价他们的相对<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3090112?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">受欢迎程度</a>和<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2429993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">认知能力</a>时，也发现了类似的趋势。问题在于，当人们无能时，他们不仅会得出错误的结论并做出不幸的选择，而且还会被剥夺意识到错误的能力。在对大学生进行的为期一个学期的<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2000-03003-015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">研究</a>中，好学生可以根据他们的分数和相对百分位数的反馈更好地预测他们在未来考试中的表现。然而，尽管有明确且反复的反馈表明他们做得不好，但表现最差的人却没有得到认可。无能的人不会对他们错误的方式感到困惑、困惑或思考，而是坚持认为他们的方式是正确的。正如查尔斯·达尔文在<em>《人类的起源》</em> （1871 年）中所写：“无知比知识更能激发自信。”</p><p>有趣的是，真正聪明的人也无法准确地自我评估自己的能力。正如 D 级和 F 级学生高估自己的能力一样，A 级学生<em>低估了</em>自己的能力。在他们的经典研究中，邓宁和克鲁格发现，认知得分位于前四分之一的表现优异的学生低估了他们的相对能力。这些学生认为，如果这些认知任务对他们来说很容易，那么对其他人来说也一定同样容易，甚至更容易。这种所谓的“冒名顶替综合症”可以比作邓宁-克鲁格效应的反面，即高成就者无法认识到自己的才能，并认为其他人同样有能力。不同之处在于，有能力的人<em>可以</em>并且<em>确实会</em>根据适当的反馈调整他们的自我评估，而无能的人则不能。</p><p>这就是不落得像无知的银行劫匪那样结局的关键。有时我们会尝试带来有利结果的事情，但其他时候——比如柠檬汁的想法——我们的方法是不完美的、不合理的、无能的或者只是愚蠢的。诀窍是不要被优越感所迷惑，并学会准确地重新评估我们的能力。毕竟，正如据说孔子所说，真正的知识是知道一个人的无知程度。</p><br><br><hr><p><span><a

rel="noreferrer noopener">69%</a>的美国人相信人们因智慧和技能而受到奖励。两国的受访者都认为，运气和来自富裕家庭等外部因素的重要性要小得多。虽然这些想法在这两个国家最为明显，但它们在<a href="https://academic.oup.com/esr/article-abstract/23/5/649/525026?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">全球范围</a>内都很流行。</p><p>尽管广为接受，但功德而非运气决定世界成败的信念显然是错误的。这尤其是因为功绩本身在很大程度上是运气的结果。才能和坚定努力的能力，有时称为“ <a

rel="noreferrer noopener">取决于</a>一个人的遗传禀赋和教养。</p><p>更不用说每个成功故事中的偶然情况了。美国经济学家罗伯特·弗兰克 (Robert Frank) 在他的<em>《成功与幸运》</em> (Success and Luck, 2016) <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10663.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">一书中</a>讲述了导致比尔·盖茨 (Bill Gates) 成为微软创始人以及弗兰克 (Bill Gates)

的说法，如果所讨论的成功是巨大的，并且取得成功的环境是竞争性的，则尤其如此。肯定有一些程序员几乎和盖茨一样技术娴熟，但却未能成为地球上最富有的人。在竞争环境中，许多人都有优点，但很少有人成功。将两者分开的是运气。</p><p><span class="ld-dropcap">除了</span>错误之外，越来越多的心理学和神经科学研究表明，相信任人唯贤会让人更自私、更少自我批评，甚至更容易以歧视的方式行事。任人唯贤不仅是错误的，而且是错误的。这不好。</p><p> “最后通牒游戏”是一种在心理实验室中很常见的实验，其中一个玩家（提议者）得到一笔钱，并被告知提议在他和另一个玩家（响应者）之间分配，后者可以接受提议或拒绝它。如果响应者拒绝提议，则双方玩家都得不到任何东西。该实验已被重复数千次，通常提议者会提供相对平均的分配。如果要分享的金额为 100 美元，则大多数报价都在 40-50 美元之间。</p><p>这个游戏的一个变体表明，相信一个人更熟练会导致更自私的行为。在北京师范大学的<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3767679/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">一项研究</a>中，参与者在最后通牒游戏中提出要约之前玩了一场虚假的技能游戏。那些（错误地）被引导相信他们“赢了”的玩家比那些没有玩技巧游戏的玩家为自己赢得了更多。其他研究证实了这一发现。明尼苏达大学的经济学家 Aldo Rustichini 和荷兰马斯特里赫特大学的 Alexander Vostroknutov <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">发现</a>，与那些参与机会游戏的人相比，首先参与技能游戏的受试者支持奖品重新分配的可能性要小得多。只要想到技能，人们就会更容忍不平等的结果。虽然发现所有参与者都是如此，但这种影响在“获胜者”中更为明显。</p><p>相比之下，对感恩的研究表明，记住运气的作用会增加慷慨度。弗兰克引用了一项研究，在这项研究中，简单地要求受试者回忆有助于他们在生活中取得成功的外部因素（运气、他人的帮助）使他们比那些被要求记住内部因素（努力）的人更有可能捐助慈善事业， 技能）。</p><p>也许更令人不安的是，仅仅将任人唯贤作为一种价值观似乎助长了歧视行为。麻省理工学院的管理学者 Emilio Castilla 和印第安纳大学的社会学家 Stephen Benard 研究了实施精英管理实践的尝试，例如私营公司的基于绩效的薪酬。他们<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">发现</a>，在明确将任人唯贤作为核心价值观的公司中，相比绩效评估相同的女性员工，管理者对男性员工的奖励更高。当任人唯贤没有被明确采纳为价值观时，这种偏好就消失了。</p><p>这是令人惊讶的，因为公正是任人唯贤道德诉求的核心。 “公平竞争环境”旨在避免基于性别、种族等的不公平的不平等现象。然而，卡斯蒂利亚和贝纳德发现，具有讽刺意味的是，实施精英管理的尝试恰恰导致了它旨在消除的不平等现象。他们认为，之所以会出现这种“贤能政治悖论”，是因为明确采用贤能政治作为一种价值观可以使主体相信他们自己的道德<em>诚意</em>。他们对自己的公正感到满意，因此不太愿意检查自己的行为是否存在偏见迹象。</p><p>任人唯贤是错误的，而且不是很有益。与任何意识形态一样，它的部分吸引力在于它为<em>现状</em>辩护，解释了为什么人们属于他们恰好处于社会秩序中的地方。人们更愿意相信世界是公正的，这是一个公认的心理学原则。</p><p>然而，除了合法化，任人唯贤也提供奉承。在成功取决于功绩的地方，每一次胜利都可以看作是一个人自身美德和价值的反映。任人唯贤是分配原则中最值得沾沾自喜的一种。它的意识形态炼金术将财产转化为赞美，将物质不平等转化为个人优越感。它允许有钱有势的人将自己视为富有成效的天才。虽然这种效应在精英阶层中最为显着，但几乎任何成就都可以通过精英的眼光来看待。高中毕业、艺术上的成功或仅仅有钱都可以被视为才华和努力的证明。出于同样的原因，世俗的失败成为个人缺陷的标志，为处于社会等级制度底层的人提供了理由留在那里。</p><p>这就是为什么关于特定个体在多大程度上是“白手起家”以及各种形式的“特权”的影响的争论会变得如此激烈。这些争论不仅仅是关于谁能拥有什么；这是关于人们可以为他们拥有的东西获得多少“信用”，关于他们的成功让他们相信自己的内在品质。这就是为什么在任人唯贤的假设下，个人成功是“运气”的结果这一观点可能具有侮辱性。承认外部因素的影响似乎淡化或否认了个人优点的存在。</p><p>尽管贤能政治为成功人士提供了道德保证和个人奉承，但它应该作为一种关于世界如何运作的信念和一种普遍的社会理想而被抛弃。这是错误的，相信它会鼓励自私、歧视和对不幸者的困境漠不关心。</p><br><br><hr><p>

Another feature is the wildly complex causal basis of many diseases, which hampers the effectiveness of interventions on those diseases – taking antibiotics for a simple bacterial infection is one thing, but taking antidepressants for depression is entirely different. In my <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Medical Nihilism</em> (2018), I brought all these arguments together to conclude that the present state of medicine is indeed in disrepair.</p><p> How should medicine face these problems? I coined the term &#39;gentle medicine&#39; to describe a number of changes that medicine could enact, with the hope that they would go some way to mitigating those problems. Some aspects of gentle medicine could involve small modifications to routine practice and present policy, while others could be more revisionary.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with clinical practice. Physicians could be less interventionist than they currently are. Of course, many physicians and surgeons are already conservative in their therapeutic approach, and my suggestion is that such therapeutic conservatism ought to be more widespread. Similarly, the hopes and expectations of patients should be carefully managed, just as the Canadian physician William Osler (1849-1919) counselled: &#39;One of the first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine.&#39; Treatment should, generally, be less aggressive, and more gentle, when feasible.</p><p> Another aspect of gentle medicine is how the medical research agenda is determined. Most research resources in medicine belong to industry, and its profit motive contributes to that &#39;obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance&#39;. It would be great if we had more experimental antibiotics in the research pipeline, and it would be good to have high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of various lifestyle factors in modulating depression (for example). Similarly, it would be good to have a malaria vaccine and treatments for what are sometimes called &#39;neglected tropical diseases&#39;, the disease burden of which is massive. The current coronavirus pandemic has displayed how little we know about some very basic but immensely important questions, such as the transmission dynamics of viruses, the influence of masks on mitigating disease transmission, and the kinds of social policies that can effectively flatten epidemic curves. But there is little industry profit to be made pursuing these research programmes. Instead, great profit can be made by developing &#39;me-too&#39; drugs – a new token of a class of drugs for which there already exist multiple tokens. A new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) could generate great profit for a company, though it would bring little benefit for patients, given that there are already many SSRIs on the market (and, in any case, their demonstrated effect sizes are extremely modest, as I argued in a recent Aeon <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-evidence-in-favour-of-antidepressants-is-terribly-flawed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essay</a> ).</p><p> <span class="ld-dropcap">A</span> policy-level change, for which some now argue, is to reduce or eliminate the intellectual property protection of medical interventions. This would have several consequences. It would, obviously, mitigate the financial incentives that appear to be corrupting medical science. It would probably also mean that new drugs would be cheaper. Certainly, the antics of people such as Martin Shkreli would be impossible. Would it also mean that there would be less innovative medical research and development? This is a tired argument often raised to defend intellectual property laws. However, it has serious problems. The history of science shows that major scientific revolutions typically occur without such incentives – think of Nicolaus Copernicus, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. Breakthroughs in medicine are no different. The most important breakthroughs in medical interventions – antibiotics, insulin, the polio vaccine – were developed in social and financial contexts that were completely unlike the context of pharmaceutical profit today. Those breakthroughs were indeed radically effective, unlike most of the blockbusters today.</p><p> Another policy-level change would be to take the testing of new pharmaceuticals out of the hands of those who stand to profit from their sale. A number of commentators have argued that there should be independence between the organisation that tests a new medical intervention and the organisation that manufactures and sells that intervention. This could contribute to raising the evidential standards to which we hold medical interventions, so that we can better learn their true benefits and harms.</p><p> Returning to the issue of the research agenda, we also need to have more rigorous evidence about gentle medicine itself. We have a mountain of evidence about the benefits and harms of initiating therapy – this is the point of the vast majority of randomised trials today. However, we have barely any rigorous evidence about the effects of terminating therapy. Since part of gentle medicine is a call to be more therapeutically conservative, we ought to have more evidence about the effects of drug discontinuation.</p><p> For example, in 2010 researchers in Israel <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applied</a> a drug discontinuation programme to a group of elderly patients taking an average of 7.7 medications. By strictly following treatment protocols, the researchers withdrew an average of 4.4 medications per patient. Of these, only six drugs (2 per cent) were re-administered due to symptom recurrence. No harms were observed during the drug discontinuations, and 88 per cent of the patients reported feeling healthier. We need much more evidence like this, and of higher quality (randomised, blinded).</p><p> Gentle medicine doesn&#39;t mean easy medicine. We might learn that regular exercise and healthy diets are more effective than many pharmaceuticals for a wide range of diseases, but regular exercise and healthy eating are not easy. Perhaps the most important health-preserving intervention during the present coronavirus pandemic is &#39;social distancing&#39;, which is completely non-medical (insofar as it doesn&#39;t involve medical professionals or medical treatments), though social distancing requires significant personal and social costs.</p><p> In short, as a response to the many problems in medicine today, gentle medicine suggests changes to clinical practice, the medical research agenda, and policies pertaining to regulation and intellectual property.</p><br><br><hr><p><span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/jacob-stegenga" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Jacob Stegenga</a> is a reader in philosophy of science at the University of Cambridge.

What they found was striking. Although the size of the study was small, every participant demonstrated such marked improvement that almost all were found to be in the normal range on testing for memory and cognition by the study&#39;s end. Functionally, this amounts to a cure.</p><p> These are important findings, not only because Alzheimer&#39;s disease is projected to become ever more common as the population ages, but because current treatment options offer minimal improvement at best. Last July, a large clinical trial found little benefit in patients receiving a major new drug called LMTX. And after that, another hopeful drug designed to target amyloid protein, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, failed its first large clinical trial as well. Just two months ago, Merck announced the results of its trial of a drug called verubecestat, which is designed to inhibit formation of amyloid protein. It was found to be no better than placebo.</p><p> The results from UCLA aren&#39;t due to an incredible new drug or medical breakthrough, though. Rather, the researchers used a protocol consisting of a variety of different lifestyle modifications to optimise metabolic parameters – such as inflammation and insulin resistance – that are associated with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Participants were counselled to change their diet (a lot of veggies), exercise, develop techniques for stress management, and improve their sleep, among other interventions. The most common &#39;side effect&#39; was weight loss.</p><p> The study is notable not only for its remarkable outcomes, but also for the alternative paradigm it represents in the treatment of a complex, chronic disease. We&#39;ve spent billions of dollars in an effort to understand the molecular basis of Alzheimer&#39;s in the hope that it will lead to a cure, or at least to more effective therapies. And although we have greatly enlarged our knowledge of the disease, it has not yielded many successful treatments.</p><p> The situation is analogous in kind, if not quite degree, to the many other chronic diseases with which we now struggle, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While we do have efficacious medications for these conditions, none work perfectly, and all have negative effects. Our understanding of the cellular processes at the root of these diseases is sophisticated, but technical mastery – the grail of a cure – has remained elusive.</p><p> Acknowledging these difficulties, the researchers at UCLA opted for a different approach. Beginning from the premise that Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a particular manifestation of a highly complex system in disarray, they sought to optimise the system by changing the inputs. Put another way, the scientists chose to set aside the molecular box which has proven so vexing, and to focus instead on the context of the box itself. Although we cannot say precisely <em>how</em> the intervention worked, on a cellular level, the important thing is that it did work.</p><p> The method isn&#39;t entirely novel. Researchers have already shown that multi-faceted, comprehensive lifestyle interventions can significantly improve outcomes in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension. But it&#39;s difficult for these approaches to gain traction for two reasons. First, these protocols are more challenging than simply taking a pill at bedtime. Patients need ongoing education, counselling and support to effect meaningful change. And second, the pharmaceutical mode of treatment is deeply embedded within our current medical system. Insurance companies are set up to pay for medication, not lifestyle change; and physicians are taught pharmacology, not nutrition.</p><p> Despite these difficulties, it&#39;s time to start taking these approaches much more seriously. The prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is expected to triple over the next three decades, to nearly 14 million in the United States alone. Diabetes and other chronic diseases are expected to follow a similar trajectory. Trying to confront this epidemic with medication alone will raise a new host of problems, from prohibitive cost to adverse effects, without addressing any underlying cause. We know that comprehensive lifestyle modification can work for many chronic diseases, in some cases as well as medication. It deserves more than passing mention at the end of an annual check-up – it&#39;s time to make it a cornerstone in the treatment not only of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but of all chronic disease.</p><br><br><hr><p><span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/clayton-dalton" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Clayton Dalton</a> is a medical resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

This was the puzzling question that the philosopher Hannah Arendt grappled with when she reported for <em>The New Yorker</em> in 1961 on the war crimes trial of Adolph Eichmann, the Nazi operative responsible for organising the transportation of millions of Jews and others to various concentration camps in support of the Nazi&#39;s Final Solution.</p><p> Arendt found Eichmann an ordinary, rather bland, bureaucrat, who in her words, was &#39;neither perverted nor sadistic&#39;, but &#39;terrifyingly normal&#39;. He acted without any motive other than to diligently advance his career in the Nazi bureaucracy. Eichmann was not an amoral monster, she concluded in her study of the case, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil</em> (1963). Instead, he performed evil deeds without evil intentions, a fact connected to his &#39;thoughtlessness&#39;, a disengagement from the reality of his evil acts. Eichmann &#39;never realised what he was doing&#39; due to an &#39;inability… to think from the standpoint of somebody else&#39;. Lacking this particular cognitive ability, he &#39;commit[ted] crimes under circumstances that made it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he [was] doing wrong&#39;.</p><p> Arendt dubbed these collective characteristics of Eichmann &#39;the banality of evil&#39;: he was not inherently evil, but merely shallow and clueless, a &#39;joiner&#39;, in the words of one contemporary interpreter of Arendt&#39;s thesis: he was a man who drifted into the Nazi Party, in search of purpose and direction, not out of deep ideological belief. In Arendt&#39;s telling, Eichmann reminds us of the protagonist in Albert Camus&#39;s novel <em>The Stranger</em> (1942), who randomly and casually kills a man, but then afterwards feels no remorse. There was no particular intention or obvious evil motive: the deed just &#39;happened&#39;.</p><p> This wasn&#39;t Arendt&#39;s first, somewhat superficial impression of Eichmann. Even 10 years after his trial in Israel, she wrote in 1971:</p><blockquote> I was struck by the manifest shallowness in the doer [ie Eichmann] which made it impossible to trace the uncontestable evil of his deeds to any deeper level of roots or motives. The deeds were monstrous, but the doer – at least the very effective one now on trial – was quite ordinary, commonplace, and neither demonic nor monstrous.</blockquote><p> The banality-of-evil thesis was a flashpoint for controversy. To Arendt&#39;s critics, it seemed absolutely inexplicable that Eichmann could have played a key role in the Nazi genocide yet have no evil intentions. Gershom Scholem, a fellow philosopher (and theologian), wrote to Arendt in 1963 that her banality-of-evil thesis was merely a slogan that &#39;does not impress me, certainly, as the product of profound analysis&#39;. Mary McCarthy, a novelist and good friend of Arendt, <a href="http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/essays/note-banality-evil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced</a> sheer incomprehension: &#39;[I]t seems to me that what you are saying is that Eichmann lacks an inherent human quality: the capacity for thought, consciousness – conscience. But then isn&#39;t he a monster simply?&#39;</p><p> The controversy continues to the present day. The philosopher Alan Wolfe, in <em>Political Evil: What It Is and How to Combat It</em> (2011), criticised Arendt for &#39;psychologising&#39; – that is, avoiding – the issue of evil as evil by defining it in the limited context of Eichmann&#39;s humdrum existence. Wolfe argued that Arendt concentrated too much on <em>who</em> Eichmann was, rather than <em>what</em> Eichmann did. For Arendt&#39;s critics, this focus on Eichmann&#39;s insignificant, banal life seemed to be an &#39;absurd digression&#39; from his evil deeds.</p><p> Other recent critics have documented Arendt&#39;s historical errors, which led her to miss a deeper evil in Eichmann, when she claimed that his evil was &#39;thought-defying&#39;, as Arendt wrote to the philosopher Karl Jaspers three years after the trial. The historian Deborah Lipstadt, the defendant in David Irving&#39;s Holocaust-denial libel trial, decided in 2000, cites documentation released by the Israeli government for use in the legal proceeding. It proves, Lipstadt asserts in <em>The Eichmann Trial</em> (2011), that Arendt&#39;s use of the term &#39;banal&#39; was flawed:</p><blockquote> The memoir [by Eichmann] released by Israel for use in my trial reveals the degree to which Arendt was wrong about Eichmann. It is permeated with expressions of Nazi ideology… [Eichmann] accepted and espoused the idea of racial purity.</blockquote><p> Lipstadt further argues that Arendt failed to explain why Eichmann and his associates would have attempted to destroy evidence of their war crimes, if he was indeed unaware of his wrongdoing.</p><p> In <em>Eichmann Before Jerusalem</em> (2014), the German historian Bettina Stangneth reveals another side to him besides the banal, seemingly apolitical man, who was just acting like any other &#39;ordinary&#39; career-oriented bureaucrat. Drawing on audiotapes of interviews with Eichmann by the Nazi journalist William Sassen, Stangneth shows Eichmann as a self-avowed, aggressive Nazi ideologue strongly committed to Nazi beliefs, who showed no remorse or guilt for his role in the Final Solution – a radically evil Third Reich operative living inside the deceptively normal shell of a bland bureaucrat. Far from being &#39;thoughtless&#39;, Eichmann had plenty of thoughts – thoughts of genocide, carried out on behalf of his beloved Nazi Party. On the tapes, Eichmann admitted to a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde dualism:</p><blockquote> I, &#39;[t]he cautious bureaucrat,&#39; that was me, yes indeed. But … this cautious bureaucrat was attended by a … a fanatical [Nazi] warrior, fighting for the freedom of my blood, which is my birthright…</blockquote><p> Arendt completely missed this radically evil side of Eichmann when she wrote 10 years after the trial that there was &#39;no sign in him of firm ideological convictions or of specific evil motives&#39;. This only underscores the banality – and falsity – of the banality-of-evil thesis. And though Arendt never said that Eichmann was just an innocent &#39;cog&#39; in the Nazi bureaucracy <em>,</em> nor defended Eichmann as &#39;just following orders&#39; – both common misunderstandings of her findings on Eichmann – her critics, including Wolfe and Lipstadt, remain unsatisfied.</p><p> <span class="ld-dropcap">S</span> o what should we conclude about Arendt&#39;s claim that Eichmann (as well as other Germans) <em>did</em> evil without <em>being</em> evil?</p><p> The question is a puzzle because Arendt missed an opportunity to investigate the larger meaning of Eichmann&#39;s particular evil by not expanding her study of him into a broader study of evil&#39;s nature. In <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em> (1951), published well before the Eichmann trial, Arendt said:</p><blockquote> It is inherent in our entire [Western] philosophical tradition that we cannot conceive of a &#39;radical evil&#39;…</blockquote><p> Instead of using the Eichmann case as a way forward to advance the tradition&#39;s understanding of radical evil, Arendt decided that his evil was banal, that is, &#39;thought-defying&#39;. By taking a narrow legalistic, formalistic approach to the trial – she emphasised that there were no deeper issues at stake beyond the legal facts of Eichmann&#39;s guilt or innocence – Arendt automatically set herself up for failure as to the deeper why of Eichmann&#39;s evil.</p><p> Yet in her writings before <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> , she actually took an opposite position. In <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em> , she argued that the evil of the Nazis was absolute and inhuman, <em>not</em> shallow and incomprehensible, the metaphorical embodiment of hell itself: &#39;[T]he reality of concentration camps resembles nothing so much as medieval pictures of Hell.&#39;</p><p> By declaring in her pre-Eichmann trial writings that absolute evil, exemplified by the Nazis, was driven by an audacious, monstrous intention to abolish humanity itself, Arendt was echoing the spirit of philosophers such as FWJ Schelling and Plato, who did not shy away from investigating the deeper, more demonic aspects of evil. But this view changed when Arendt met Eichmann, whose bureaucratic emptiness suggested no such diabolical profundity, but only prosaic careerism and the &#39;inability to think&#39;. At that point, her earlier imaginative thinking about moral evil was distracted, and the &#39;banality of evil&#39; slogan was born. Moreover, Arendt died in 1975: perhaps if she had lived longer she could have clarified the puzzles surrounding the banality-of-evil thesis, which still confound critics to this day. But this we shall never know.</p><p> Thus we are left with her original thesis as it stands. What is the basic confusion behind it? Arendt never did reconcile her impressions of Eichmann&#39;s bureaucratic banality with her earlier searing awareness of the evil, inhuman acts of the Third Reich. She saw the ordinary-looking functionary, but not the ideologically evil warrior. How Eichmann&#39;s humdrum life could co-exist with that &#39;other&#39; monstrous evil puzzled her. Nevertheless, Arendt never downplayed Eichmann&#39;s guilt, repeatedly described him as a war criminal, and concurred with his death sentence as handed down by the Israeli court. Though Eichmann&#39;s motives were, for her, obscure and thought-defying, his genocidal acts were not. In the final analysis, Arendt <em>did</em> see the true horror of Eichmann&#39;s evil.</p><br><br><hr><p> <span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/thomas-white" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Thomas White</a> is a Wiley Journal contributing author, whose philosophical and theological writings have appeared in print and online.</span></p><hr> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Invalid Date</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://aeon.co/ideas/what-did-hannah-arendt-really-mean-by-the-banality-of-evil</guid><link/> https://aeon.co/ideas/what-did-hannah-arendt-really-mean-by-the-banality-of-evil <author><![CDATA[Thomas White]]></author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why philosophy is so important in science education]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://epsilon.aeon.co/images/963dfa1f-3028-4555-98d2-452699a0d042/idea_sized-40_cgf_still_00022_1600.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><p> Each semester, I teach courses on the philosophy of science to undergraduates at the University of New Hampshire. Most of the students take my courses to satisfy general education requirements, and most of them have never taken a philosophy class before.</p><p> On the first day of the semester, I try to give them an impression of what the philosophy of science is about. I begin by explaining to them that philosophy addresses issues that can&#39;t be settled by facts alone, and that the philosophy of <em>science</em> is the application of this approach to the domain of science. After this, I explain some concepts that will be central to the course: induction, evidence, and method in scientific enquiry. I tell them that science proceeds by induction, the practices of drawing on past observations to make general claims about what has not yet been observed, but that philosophers see induction as inadequately justified, and therefore <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problematic</a> for science. I then touch on the difficulty of deciding which evidence fits which hypothesis uniquely, and why getting this right is vital for any scientific research. I let them know that &#39;the scientific method&#39; is <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-scientific-method-came-from-watching-children-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> singular and straightforward, and that there are basic <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-should-science-have-the-last-word-on-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputes</a> about what scientific methodology should look like. Lastly, I stress that although these issues are &#39;philosophical&#39;, they nevertheless have real <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/when-does-science-finally-take-no-for-an-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consequences</a> for how science is done.</p><p> At this point, I&#39;m often asked questions such as: &#39;What are your qualifications?&#39; &#39;Which school did you attend?&#39; and &#39;Are you a scientist?&#39;</p><p> Perhaps they ask these questions because, as a female philosopher of Jamaican extraction, I embody an unfamiliar cluster of identities, and they are curious about me. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s partly right, but I think that there&#39;s more to it, because I&#39;ve observed a similar pattern in a philosophy of science course taught by a more stereotypical professor. As a graduate student at Cornell University in New York, I served as a teaching assistant for a course on human nature and evolution. The professor who taught it made a very different physical impression than I do. He was white, male, bearded and in his 60s – the very image of academic authority. But students were skeptical of his views about science, because, as some said, disapprovingly: &#39;He isn&#39;t a scientist.&#39;</p><p> I think that these responses have to do with concerns about the value of philosophy compared with that of science. It is no wonder that some of my students are doubtful that philosophers have anything useful to say about science. They are aware that prominent scientists have stated publicly that philosophy is irrelevant to science, if not utterly worthless and anachronistic. They know that STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education is accorded vastly greater importance than anything that the humanities have to offer.</p><p> Many of the young people who attend my classes think that philosophy is a fuzzy discipline that&#39;s concerned only with matters of opinion, whereas science is in the business of discovering facts, delivering proofs, and disseminating objective truths. Furthermore, many of them believe that scientists can answer philosophical questions, but philosophers have no business weighing in on scientific ones.</p><p> <span class="ld-dropcap">W</span> hy do college students so often treat philosophy as wholly distinct from and subordinate to science? In my experience, four reasons stand out.</p><p> One has to do with a lack of historical awareness. College students tend to think that departmental divisions mirror sharp divisions in the world, and so they cannot appreciate that philosophy and science, as well as the purported divide between them, are dynamic human creations. Some of the subjects that are now labelled &#39;science&#39; once fell under different headings. Physics, the most secure of the sciences, was once the purview of &#39;natural philosophy&#39;. And music was once at home in the faculty of mathematics. The scope of science has both narrowed and broadened, depending on the time and place and cultural contexts where it was practised.</p><p> Another reason has to do with concrete results. Science solves real-world problems. It gives us technology: things that we can touch, see and use. It gives us vaccines, GMO crops, and painkillers. Philosophy doesn&#39;t seem, to the students, to have any tangibles to show. But, to the contrary, philosophical tangibles are many: Albert Einstein&#39;s philosophical thought experiments made Cassini possible. Aristotle&#39;s logic is the basis for computer science, which gave us laptops and smartphones. And philosophers&#39; work on the mind-body problem set the stage for the emergence of neuropsychology and therefore brain-imagining technology. Philosophy has always been quietly at work in the background of science.</p><p> A third reason has to do with concerns about truth, objectivity and bias. Science, students insist, is purely objective, and anyone who challenges that view must be misguided. A person is not deemed to be objective if she approaches her research with a set of background assumptions. Instead, she&#39;s &#39;ideological&#39;. But <em>all</em> of us are &#39;biased&#39; and our biases fuel the creative work of science. This issue can be difficult to address, because a naive conception of objectivity is so ingrained in the popular image of what science is. To approach it, I invite students to look at something nearby <em>without any presuppositions</em> . I then ask them to tell me what they see. They pause… and then recognise that they can&#39;t interpret their experiences without drawing on prior ideas. Once they notice this, the <a href="https://aeon.co/videos/models-are-always-imperfect-and-the-ones-we-choose-greatly-shape-our-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea</a> that it can be appropriate to ask questions about objectivity in science ceases to be so strange.</p><p> The fourth source of students&#39; discomfort comes from what they take science education to be. One gets the impression that they think of science as mainly itemising the things that exist – &#39;the facts&#39; – and of science education as teaching them what these facts are. I don&#39;t conform to these expectations. But as a philosopher, I am mainly concerned with how these facts get selected and interpreted, why some are regarded as more significant than others, the ways in which facts are infused with presuppositions, and so on.</p><p> <span class="ld-dropcap">S</span> tudents often respond to these concerns by stating impatiently that <em>facts are facts</em> . But to say that a thing is identical to itself is not to say anything interesting about it. What students mean to say by &#39;facts are facts&#39; is that once we have &#39;the facts&#39; there is no room for interpretation or disagreement.</p><p> Why do they think this way? It&#39;s not because this is the way that science is practised but rather, because this is how science is normally taught. There are a daunting number of facts and procedures that students must master if they are to become scientifically literate, and they have only a limited amount of time in which to learn them. Scientists must design their courses to keep up with rapidly expanding empirical knowledge, and they do not have the leisure of devoting hours of class-time to questions that they probably are not trained to address. The unintended consequence is that students often come away from their classes without being aware that philosophical questions are relevant to scientific theory and practice.</p><p> But things don&#39;t have to be this way. If the right educational platform is laid, philosophers like me will not have to work against the wind to convince our students that we have something important to say about science. For this we need assistance from our scientist colleagues, whom students see as the only legitimate purveyors of scientific knowledge. I propose an explicit division of labour. Our scientist colleagues should continue to teach the fundamentals of science, but they can help by making clear to their students that science brims with important conceptual, interpretative, methodological and ethical issues that philosophers are uniquely situated to address, and that far from being irrelevant to science, philosophical matters lie at its heart.</p><br><br><hr><p> <span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/subrena-smith" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Subrena E Smith</a> is assistant professor in philosophy at the University of New Hampshire.</span></p><hr> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Invalid Date</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://aeon.co/ideas/why-philosophy-is-so-important-in-science-education</guid><link/> https://aeon.co/ideas/why-philosophy-is-so-important-in-science-education <author><![CDATA[Subrena E Smith]]></author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Monopoly was invented to demonstrate the evils of capitalism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://omicron.aeon.co/images/c27e951e-8d87-4039-b26e-9b3f7998c5bb/idea_sized-mark-strozier-1583486_c6221ed17c_o.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><p> &#39;Buy land – they aren&#39;t making it any more,&#39; quipped Mark Twain. It&#39;s a maxim that would certainly serve you well in a game of Monopoly, the bestselling board game that has taught generations of children to buy up property, stack it with hotels, and charge fellow players sky-high rents for the privilege of accidentally landing there.</p><p> The game&#39;s little-known inventor, Elizabeth Magie, would no doubt have made herself go directly to jail if she&#39;d lived to know just how influential today&#39;s twisted version of her game has turned out to be.为什么？ Because it encourages its players to celebrate exactly the opposite values to those she intended to champion.</p><p> Born in 1866, Magie was an outspoken rebel against the norms and politics of her times. She was unmarried into her 40s, independent and proud of it, and made her point with a publicity stunt. Taking out a newspaper advertisement, she offered herself as a &#39;young woman American slave&#39; for sale to the highest bidder. Her aim, she told shocked readers, was to highlight the subordinate position of women in society. &#39;We are not machines,&#39; she said. &#39;Girls have minds, desires, hopes and ambition.&#39;</p><p> In addition to confronting gender politics, Magie decided to take on the capitalist system of property ownership – this time not through a publicity stunt but in the form of a board game. The inspiration began with a book that her father, the anti-monopolist politician James Magie, had handed to her. In the pages of Henry George&#39;s classic, <em>Progress</em> <em>and Poverty</em> (1879) <em>,</em> she encountered his conviction that &#39;the equal right of all men to use the land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the air – it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence&#39;.</p><p> Travelling around America in the 1870s, George had witnessed persistent destitution amid growing wealth, and he believed it was largely the inequity of land ownership that bound these two forces – poverty and progress – together. So instead of following Twain by encouraging his fellow citizens to buy land, he called on the state to tax it. On what grounds? Because much of land&#39;s value comes not from what is built on the plot but from nature&#39;s gift of water or minerals that might lie beneath its surface, or from the communally created value of its surroundings: nearby roads and railways; a thriving economy, a safe neighbourhood; good local schools and hospitals. And he argued that the tax receipts should be invested on behalf of all.</p><p> Determined to prove the merit of George&#39;s proposal, Magie invented and in 1904 patented what she called the Landlord&#39;s Game. Laid out on the board as a circuit (which was a novelty at the time), it was populated with streets and landmarks for sale. The key innovation of her game, however, lay in the two sets of rules that she wrote for playing it.</p><p> Under the &#39;Prosperity&#39; set of rules, every player gained each time someone acquired a new property (designed to reflect George&#39;s policy of taxing the value of land), and the game was won (by all!) when the player who had started out with the least money had doubled it. Under the &#39;Monopolist&#39; set of rules, in contrast, players got ahead by acquiring properties and collecting rent from all those who were unfortunate enough to land there – and whoever managed to bankrupt the rest emerged as the sole winner (sound a little familiar?).</p><p> The purpose of the dual sets of rules, said Magie, was for players to experience a &#39;practical demonstration of the present system of land grabbing with all its usual outcomes and consequences&#39; and hence to understand how different approaches to property ownership can lead to vastly different social outcomes. &#39;It might well have been called “The Game of Life”,&#39; remarked Magie, &#39;as it contains all the elements of success and failure in the real world, and the object is the same as the human race in general seems to have, ie, the accumulation of wealth.&#39;</p><p> The game was soon a hit among Left-wing intellectuals, on college campuses including the Wharton School, Harvard and Columbia, and also among Quaker communities, some of which modified the rules and redrew the board with street names from Atlantic City. Among the players of this Quaker adaptation was an unemployed man called Charles Darrow, who later sold such a modified version to the games company Parker Brothers as his own.</p><p> Once the game&#39;s true origins came to light, Parker Brothers bought up Magie&#39;s patent, but then re-launched the board game simply as Monopoly, and provided the eager public with just one set of rules: those that celebrate the triumph of one over all. Worse, they marketed it along with the claim that the game&#39;s inventor was Darrow, who they said had dreamed it up in the 1930s, sold it to Parker Brothers, and become a millionaire. It was a rags-to-riches fabrication that ironically exemplified Monopoly&#39;s implicit values: chase wealth and crush your opponents if you want to come out on top.</p><p> So next time someone invites you to join a game of Monopoly, here&#39;s a thought. As you set out piles for the Chance and Community Chest cards, establish a third pile for Land-Value Tax, to which every property owner must contribute each time they charge rent to a fellow player. How high should that land tax be? And how should the resulting tax receipts be distributed? Such questions will no doubt lead to fiery debate around the Monopoly board – but then that is exactly what Magie had always hoped for.</p><br><br><hr><p> <span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/kate-raworth" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Kate Raworth</a> is a senior visiting research associate at Oxford University&#39;s Environmental Change Institute and a senior associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.

Or are we, deep down, wired to be bad, blinkered, idle, vain, vengeful and selfish? There are no easy answers, and there&#39;s clearly a lot of variation between individuals, but here we shine some evidence-based light on the matter through 10 dispiriting findings that reveal the darker and less impressive aspects of human nature:</p><p> <strong>We view minorities and the vulnerable as less than human.</strong> One striking example of this blatant dehumanisation came from a brain-scan <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/11/10/seeing-others-as-less-than-human/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> that found a small group of students exhibited less neural activity associated with thinking about people when they looked at pictures of the homeless or of drug addicts, as compared with higher-status individuals. Another study showed that people who are opposed to Arab immigration tended to rate Arabs and Muslims as literally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less evolved</a> than average. Among other examples, there&#39;s also evidence that young people dehumanise <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08227-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older people</a> ; and that men and women alike dehumanise <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0958-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drunk women</a> . What&#39;s more, the inclination to dehumanise starts <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.12539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early</a> – children as young as five view out-group faces (of people from a different city or a different gender to the child) as less human than in-group faces.</p><p> <strong>We experience</strong> <em><strong>Schadenfreude</strong></em> <strong>(pleasure at another person&#39;s distress) by the age of four,</strong> according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjdp.12013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from 2013. That sense is heightened if the child perceives that the person deserves the distress. A more recent <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0264-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that, by age six, children will pay to watch an antisocial puppet being hit, rather than spending the money on stickers.</p><p> <strong>We believe in karma – assuming that the downtrodden of the world deserve their fate.</strong> The unfortunate consequences of such beliefs were first demonstrated in the now classic <a href="http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> from 1966 by the American psychologists Melvin Lerner and Carolyn Simmons. In their experiment, in which a female learner was punished with electric shocks for wrong answers, women participants subsequently rated her as less likeable and admirable when they heard that they would be seeing her suffer again, and especially if they felt powerless to minimise this suffering. Since then, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown our willingness to blame the poor, rape victims, AIDS patients and others for their fate, so as to preserve our belief in a just world. By extension, the same or similar processes are likely responsible for our subconscious rose-tinted view of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1368430215596075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rich people</a> .</p><p> <strong>We are blinkered and dogmatic.</strong> If people were rational and open-minded, then the straightforward way to correct someone&#39;s false beliefs would be to present them with some relevant facts. However a classic <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-05421-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from 1979 showed the futility of this approach – participants who believed strongly for or against the death penalty completely ignored facts that undermined their position, actually doubling-down on their initial view. This seems to occur in part because we see opposing facts as undermining our sense of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0163853X.2015.1136507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identity</a> . It doesn&#39;t help that many of us are <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xge-xge0000161.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overconfident</a> about how much we understand things and that, when we believe our opinions are superior to others, this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deters us</a> from seeking out further relevant knowledge.</p><p> <strong>We would rather electrocute ourselves than spend time in our own thoughts.</strong> This was demonstrated in a controversial 2014 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6192/75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in which 67 per cent of male participants and 25 per cent of female participants opted to give themselves unpleasant electric shocks rather than spend 15 minutes in peaceful contemplation.</p><p> <strong>We are vain and overconfident.</strong> Our irrationality and dogmatism might not be so bad were they married to some humility and self-insight, but most of us walk about with inflated views of our abilities and qualities, such as our driving skills, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelligence</a> and attractiveness – a phenomenon that&#39;s been dubbed the Lake Wobegon Effect after the fictional town where &#39;all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average&#39;. Ironically, the least skilled among us are the most prone to overconfidence (the so-called Dunning-Kruger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effect</a> ). This vain self-enhancement seems to be most extreme and irrational in the case of our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641986/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morality</a> , such as in how principled and fair we think we are. In fact, even jailed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criminals</a> think they are kinder, more trustworthy and honest than the average member of the public.</p><p> <strong>We are moral hypocrites.</strong> It pays to be wary of those who are the quickest and loudest in condemning the moral failings of others – the chances are that moral preachers are as guilty themselves, but take a far lighter view of their own transgressions. In one <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108000553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> , researchers found that people rated the exact same selfish behaviour (giving themselves the quicker and easier of two experimental tasks on offer) as being far less fair when perpetuated by others. Similarly, there is a long-studied phenomenon known as actor-observer asymmetry, which in part describes our <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217711918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tendency</a> to attribute other people&#39;s bad deeds, such as our partner&#39;s <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2017.1350578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infidelities</a> , to their character, while attributing the same deeds performed by ourselves to the situation at hand. These self-serving double standards could even explain the common feeling that incivility is on the increase – recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873069/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> shows that we view the same acts of rudeness far more harshly when they are committed by strangers than by our friends or ourselves.</p><p> <strong>We are all potential trolls.</strong> As anyone who has found themselves in a spat on Twitter will attest, social media might be magnifying some of the worst aspects of human nature, in part due to the online <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disinhibition</a> effect, and the fact that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anonymity</a> (easy to achieve online) is known to increase our inclinations for immorality. While research has suggested that people who are prone to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613490749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyday sadism</a> (a worryingly high proportion of us) are especially <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inclined</a> to online trolling, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published last year revealed how being in a bad mood, and being exposed to trolling by others, double the likelihood of a person engaging in trolling themselves. In fact, initial trolling by a few can cause a snowball of increasing negativity, which is exactly what researchers found when they studied reader discussion on CNN.com, with the &#39;proportion of flagged posts and proportion of users with flagged posts … rising over time&#39;.</p><p> <strong>We favour ineffective leaders with psychopathic traits.</strong> The American personality psychologist Dan McAdams recently <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.26613/esic.1.2.45#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> that the US President Donald Trump&#39;s overt aggression and insults have a &#39;primal appeal&#39;, and that his &#39;incendiary Tweets&#39; are like the &#39;charging displays&#39; of an alpha male chimp, &#39;designed to intimidate&#39;. If McAdams&#39;s assessment is true, it would fit into a wider pattern – the finding that psychopathic traits are more common than average among leaders. Take the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14999013.2014.951103?journalCode=ufmh20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> of financial leaders in New York that found they scored highly on psychopathic traits but lower than average in emotional intelligence. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327039686_Shall_We_Serve_the_Dark_Lords_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Psychopathy_and_Leadership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meta-analysis</a> published this summer concluded that there is indeed a modest but significant link between higher trait psychopathy and gaining leadership positions, which is important since psychopathy also correlates with poorer leadership.</p><p> <strong>We are sexually attracted to people with dark personality traits.</strong> Not only do we elect people with psychopathic traits to become our leaders, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213483580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> that men and women are sexually attracted, at least in the short term, to people displaying the so-called &#39;dark triad&#39; of traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – thus risking further propagating these traits. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913012245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that a man&#39;s physical attractiveness to women was increased when he was described as self-interested, manipulative and insensitive. One theory is that the dark traits successfully communicate &#39;mate quality&#39; in terms of confidence and the willingness to take risks. Does this matter for the future of our species? Perhaps it does – another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816300010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> , from 2016, found that those women who were more strongly attracted to narcissistic men&#39;s faces tended to have more children.</p><p> Don&#39;t get too down – these findings say nothing of the success that some of us have had in overcoming our baser instincts.

No matter how exotic the locale or how unusual the scientific concepts, most science fiction ends up being about quintessentially human (or human-like) interactions, problems, foibles and challenges. This is what we respond to; it is what we can best understand. In practice, this means that most science fiction takes place in relatively relatable settings, on a planet or spacecraft. The real challenge is to tie the story to human emotions, and human sizes and timescales, while still capturing the enormous scales of the Universe itself.</p><p> Just how large the Universe actually is never fails to boggle the mind. We say that the observable Universe extends for tens of billions of light years, but the only way to really comprehend this, as humans, is to break matters down into a series of steps, starting with our visceral understanding of the size of the Earth. A non-stop flight from Dubai to San Francisco covers a distance of about 8,000 miles – roughly equal to the diameter of the Earth. The Sun is much bigger; its diameter is just over 100 times Earth&#39;s. And the distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 100 times larger than <em>that</em> , close to 100 million miles. This distance, the radius of the Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun, is a fundamental measure in astronomy; the Astronomical Unit, or AU. The spacecraft <em>Voyager</em> 1, for example, launched in 1977 and, travelling at 11 miles per second, is now <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">137 AU</a> from the Sun.</p><p> But the stars are <em>far</em> more distant than this. The nearest, Proxima Centauri, is about 270,000 AU, or 4.25 light years away. You would have to line up 30 million Suns to span the gap between the Sun and Proxima Centauri. The Vogons in Douglas Adams&#39;s <em>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (1979) are shocked that humans have not travelled to the Proxima Centauri system to see the Earth&#39;s demolition notice; the joke is just how impossibly large the distance is.</p><p> Four light years turns out to be about the average distance between stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, of which the Sun is a member. That is a lot of empty space! The Milky Way contains about 300 billion stars, in a vast structure roughly 100,000 light years in diameter. One of the truly exciting discoveries of the past two decades is that our Sun is far from unique in hosting a retinue of planets: evidence shows that the majority of Sun-like stars in the Milky Way have planets orbiting them, many with a size and distance from their parent star allowing them to host life as we know it.</p><p> Yet getting to these planets is another matter entirely: <em>Voyager</em> 1 would arrive at Proxima Centauri in 75,000 years if it were travelling in the right direction – which it isn&#39;t. Science-fiction writers use a variety of tricks to span these interstellar distances: putting their passengers into states of suspended animation during the long voyages, or travelling close to the speed of light (to take advantage of the time dilation predicted in Albert Einstein&#39;s theory of special relativity). Or they invoke warp drives, wormholes or other as-yet undiscovered phenomena.</p><p> When astronomers made the first definitive measurements of the scale of our Galaxy a century ago, they were overwhelmed by the size of the Universe they had mapped. Initially, there was great skepticism that the so-called &#39;spiral nebulae&#39; seen in deep photographs of the sky were in fact &#39;island universes&#39; – structures as large as the Milky Way, but at much larger distances still. While the vast majority of science-fiction stories stay within our Milky Way, much of the story of the past 100 years of astronomy has been the discovery of just how much larger than that the Universe is. Our nearest galactic neighbour is about 2 million light years away, while the light from the most distant galaxies our telescopes can see has been travelling to us for most of the age of the Universe, about 13 billion years.</p><p> We discovered in the 1920s that the Universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. But about 20 years ago, astronomers found that this expansion was speeding up, driven by a force whose physical nature we do not understand, but to which we give the stop-gap name of &#39;dark energy&#39;. Dark energy operates on length- and time-scales of the Universe as a whole: how could we capture such a concept in a piece of fiction?</p><p> The story doesn&#39;t stop there. We can&#39;t see galaxies from those parts of the Universe for which there hasn&#39;t been enough time since the Big Bang for the light to reach us. What lies beyond the observable bounds of the Universe? Our simplest cosmological models suggest that the Universe is uniform in its properties on the largest scales, and extends forever. A variant idea says that the Big Bang that birthed our Universe is only one of a (possibly infinite) number of such explosions, and that the resulting &#39;multiverse&#39; has an extent utterly beyond our comprehension.</p><p> The US astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson once said: &#39;The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.&#39; Similarly, the wonders of the Universe are under no obligation to make it easy for science-fiction writers to tell stories about them. The Universe is mostly empty space, and the distances between stars in galaxies, and between galaxies in the Universe, are incomprehensibly vast on human scales. Capturing the true scale of the Universe, while somehow tying it to human endeavours and emotions, is a daunting challenge for any science-fiction writer. Olaf Stapledon took up that challenge in his novel <em>Star Maker</em> (1937), in which the stars and nebulae, and cosmos as a whole, are conscious. While we are humbled by our tiny size relative to the cosmos, our brains can none the less comprehend, to some extent, just how large the Universe we inhabit is. This is hopeful, since, as the astrobiologist <a href="https://aeon.co/users/caleb-scharf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caleb Scharf</a> of Columbia University has said: &#39;In a finite world, a cosmic perspective isn&#39;t a luxury, it is a necessity.&#39; Conveying this to the public is the real challenge faced by astronomers and science-fiction writers alike.</p><p> <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10799.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour</em></a> by Michael Strauss, Neil deGrasse Tyson and J Richard Gott is out now through Princeton University Press.</p><br><br><hr><p> <span><a href="https://aeon.co/users/michael-strauss" class="styled__AuthorLink-sc-1qwbiba-1 hzjTns">Michael Strauss</a> is a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University in New Jersey.
