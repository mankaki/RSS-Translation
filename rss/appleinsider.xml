200 亿欧元的税款，委员会称这些利润本应由爱尔兰征税。”</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> “苹果公司已经缴纳了爱尔兰税法规定的应缴税款，”比尔德继续说道。</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>自事件开始以来，税收格局发生了巨大变化，爱尔兰成为<a

AI 模型系列 Firefly</a> 。使用此工具，艺术家可以简单地输入文本来描述他们想要添加到他们的创作中的内容。想在晚上把一只鹿放在小巷里吗？ Firefly 可以通过这个新增功能帮助您。</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>今天，Adobe 将生成填充直接引入 Photoshop 应用程序，面向测试版用户。该公司表示，该功能将在 2023 年下半年更广泛地推出。</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>至于新的 Generative Fill 功能，Adobe 表示它旨在充当用户的副驾驶，以简化他们的创造力。 Generative Fill 允许用户在工作时非破坏性地添加、扩展或删除图像中的内容。只需使用简单的文本提示，如“黄色道路线”，就可以将它们带入您的自行车手形象。 </p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="primis-ad-wrap"></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><blockquote> Adobe 数字媒体高级副总裁 Ashley Still 表示：“通过将 Firefly 作为创意副驾驶直接集成到工作流程中，Adobe 正在加速我们所有客户的构思、探索和制作。” “Generative Fill 将生成 AI 的速度和易用性与 Photoshop 的强大和精确相结合，使客户能够以他们想象的速度将他们的愿景变为现实。”</blockquote></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>生成填充适用于每个单独的作品。它会自动匹配用户正在处理的图像风格，同时还会匹配照明和透视。以下是主要要点：</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><ul><li><b>由 Firefly 提供支持：</b> Firefly 旨在生成可安全用于商业用途的图像，并在 Adob​​e Stock 数以亿计的专业级许可高分辨率图像上进行训练，有助于确保 Firefly 不会根据其他人的图像生成内容或品牌的知识产权 (IP)。</li><li><b>通过简单的文本提示，神奇地从想法跳到图像：</b>添加、扩展或删除图像中的内容以获得惊人的结果。</li><li><b>非破坏性编辑：</b>在生成层中创建新生成的内容，使您能够快速迭代无数的创意可能性并在需要时反转效果，而不会影响原始图像。</li><li><b>以变​​革性的速度进行创作：</b>试验现成的想法，构思不同的概念，并尽可能快地输入高质量内容的无限变化。</li><li><b>作为网络工具提供：</b>生成填充也作为 Firefly 测试版中的一个新模块提供给有兴趣在网络上测试新功能的用户。</li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>如前所述，Firefly 于 2023 年早些时候推出，其主要重点是生成图像和文本效果。显然，这对 Adob​​e 来说是一个巨大的成功，因为该公司今天的公告还指出，测试版软件的用户已经产生了超过 1 亿的资产。</p></div><p></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 11:43:16 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

However, those types of desks tend to be major commitments that take up significant space in your home.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Lillipad hopes to solve this with an all-in-one sit, stand, and store solution. The company&#39;s desks can fold up into a portable, storable slab not entirely dissimilar from an ironing board or card table.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> This is a desk built with temporary use and storage in mind. If those are your priorities in a desk, Lillipad was made for you. </p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h2 data-anchor="lillipad-desk-design-and-assembly" id="lillipad-desk-design-and-assembly"> Lillipad desk design and assembly</h2></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> We reviewed the 48-inch desk with a maple top. Lillipad included a single monitor arm, but a dual monitor arm is also available.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110228-Lillipad-2-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110228-Lillipad-2-xl.jpg" alt="无需组装" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">No assembly required</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> There isn&#39;t any need to assemble the Lillipad desk since it comes ready to go out of the box. Attaching and removing the monitor arm is easy, but cable management might prove time-consuming.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The tabletop is flat with a 52-inch by 25-inch area. The legs of the desk are attached in an &quot;X&quot; formation, similar to an ironing board, with two foot tubes jutting out either side at the floor.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The desk weighs 78 pounds and is easy to maneuver thanks to the wheels attached to the foot tubes. The tabletop is rated for up to 75 pounds of load.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110231-Lillipad-5-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110231-Lillipad-5-xl.jpg" alt="The desk won't move when in use thanks to an included wheel brace" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">The desk won&#39;t move when in use thanks to an included wheel brace</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> This sit-stand desk goes up to 48 inches high and shrinks to 6 inches for storage. We could easily fit it under our bed or standing in a closet.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The lowest operating height is 27 inches. We used the desk at 30 inches sitting and 40 inches standing.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The desk has an integrated surge protector with three grounded outlets, a USB-A port, and a USB-C port. The height controller has two additional USB-A ports on the side for easy access.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110229-Lillipad-3-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110229-Lillipad-3-xl.jpg" alt="Two USB-A ports are in the height controller" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">Two USB-A ports are in the height controller</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Lillipad is available with 42-inch and 48-inch tabletop options. The available finishes include oak, maple, black, and white.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The desk is well-designed and minimal on its own, but it gets messy quickly as you add power-hungry products. There is barely any cable management for Lillipad, likely due to its temporary nature, but that isn&#39;t ideal.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> A net stores the desk&#39;s power cable when not in use, but we&#39;ve repurposed that to hold our monitor&#39;s power supply.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110232-Lillipad-6-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110232-Lillipad-6-xl.jpg" alt="Netting in the bottom of the desk provides some storage for cables or power supplies" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">Netting in the bottom of the desk provides some storage for cables or power supplies</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The rear of the desk has a single cable guide on the left side, opposite the power strip. If you&#39;ve got the ideal set of cables that are the right length, this might work, but we weren&#39;t able to take advantage of it.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Also, note that as the desk raises and lowers, the &quot;X&quot; legs move through slots in the desk&#39;s base. Be incredibly careful running cables underneath the desk, or they could get pulled or pinched by the moving legs. </p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h2 data-anchor="using-the-lillipad-desk" id="using-the-lillipad-desk">Using the Lillipad desk</h2></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Pop the Lillipad desk out of your storage location, raise it to sitting height, and you&#39;re ready to go.

This way, we could just remove our monitor, keyboard, laptop, etc., and put away the desk with all the cables still there, ready for next time.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Sure, that would mean needing a second set of cables for your products, but if you&#39;re in the market for a $1,500 folding desk on wheels, that&#39;s likely not an issue. </p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h3 data-anchor="how-to-raise-lower-and-store-the-lillipad-desk" id="how-to-raise-lower-and-store-the-lillipad-desk"> How to raise, lower, and store the Lillipad desk</h3></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Raising and lowering the Lillipad is a little more involved than other sit-stand desks we&#39;ve encountered. Press and hold the lock button to enable movement, then press and hold the up or down arrow to raise or lower the height.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110236-Lillipad-10-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110236-Lillipad-10-xl.jpg" alt="Those holes are used for the legs to travel through when changing height" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">Those holes are used for the legs to travel through when changing height</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> To go below 27 inches for storage, the lock button has to be pressed three times and then held while pressing the down button. All products should be removed from the desk and unplugged when doing this.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Lillipad has two memory buttons can be programmed. Pressing the memory button doesn&#39;t automatically take the desk to that height. Instead, the user holds them, and the desk keeps moving until it reaches a predefined height.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Since the desk is on wheels, raising and lowering the desk might require some user input to keep the desk from rolling the wrong way. The included wheel brace worked fine, but it does make the desk move left or right as it raises or lowers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> We stored the desk against a wall in our den between two bookshelves. There were several inches on either side, so it felt like a good spot.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110230-Lillipad-4-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110230-Lillipad-4-xl.jpg" alt="Ensure there is enough space for the desk to raise and lower" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">Ensure there is enough space for the desk to raise and lower</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> However, when we started raising the desk, the wheel lock kept the right foot tube stationary while the left foot tube rolled to the right. That pushed the tabletop to the right and impacted the right bookshelf.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Since this product is on wheels, and because of the leg&#39;s &quot;X&quot; formation, this desk isn&#39;t going straight up and down. It&#39;s more of a diagonal movement if one set of wheels is locked.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> So, in our case, we had to raise while pushing the desk over to ensure it stayed centered between the shelves. That&#39;s just the nature of the desk, not necessarily a detriment.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h3 data-anchor="lillipad-as-a-desk" id="lillipad-as-a-desk"> Lillipad as a desk</h3></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Once everything is set up and you&#39;re at the working height, Lillipad becomes a piece of background furniture, for the most part. Since the legs are connected to the desk at the back, all of the desk&#39;s support is at the back.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> That means you&#39;ll feel the desk give if you rest your arms on the desk, press down to draw, or lean over the desk. It&#39;s not a lot of give, and it doesn&#39;t feel fragile or unsafe, but it&#39;s there.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"> <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110235-Lillipad-9-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54429-110235-Lillipad-9-xl.jpg" alt="The monitor arm is easy to set up" height="738" loading="lazy" class="img-responsive article-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></div><div class="col-sm-12"> <span class="carousel-caption">The monitor arm is easy to set up and is VESA compatible</span></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The monitor arm is versatile and offers plenty of positioning options with little to no effort. Just ensure your cables are long enough to go from monitor to device.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The desk has an integrated power strip with three outlets. That&#39;s great if you need only to plug in three products.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> With our <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad" title="iPad" data-kpt="1">iPad</a> hub, monitor, and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv" title="苹果电视" data-kpt="1">Apple TV</a> , we quickly ran out of outlets on the desk.

Many workers today use cloud services such as Google Drive or Dropbox for such transfers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> But there are more sophisticated tools available that give you more flexibility and accuracy when doing network file transfers. Two such tools are SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and rsync, or remote sync.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> We&#39;ll discuss SFTP first, then take a loot at rsync and how to use it to intelligently transfer and sync files over networks. </p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="primis-ad-wrap"></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h2 data-anchor="ftp" id="ftp"> FTP</h2></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> FTP, or <em>File Transfer Protocol</em> dates back to 1971 when its original specification was published in RFC 114, and later amended in 1980 during the switch to TCP/IP, and again in 1994 (RFC 1579), and 1997 (RFC 2228). The latter two standards added passive mode and anonymous server logins, if the server is configured for it.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> FTP follows the client/server model, where users log in to an FTP server using a client app, and then use the client app to transfer files to and from the server. The FTP protocol uses two channels of communications, one for control, and one for data transfers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Most standard FTP servers use port 21 for connections. Other ports can be used, depending on how a server is configured.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Passive mode was added mainly for servers behind firewalls, which can negotiate which port number to use. Once a connection is made by a client in passive mode, the server transmits which port number to use.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Most FTP connections transfer files in either <em>text mode</em> or <em>binary mode</em> , although two other rarely used modes (EBCIDIC and Unicode) are possible.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> The one glaring omission in standard FTP connections is that all data in both directions is sent in the clear as plain text - <em>including the user&#39;s login name and password</em> . Obviously in today&#39;s world you want to avoid plain FTP as much as possible.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h2 data-anchor="enter-sftp" id="enter-sftp"> Enter SFTP</h2></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> When the <em>Secure Shell</em> was released to the public in 1994, it provided a way to log in to remote UNIX and Linux-based computers using a secured, encrypted tunnel. All data passing through an SSH tunnel is end-to-end encrypted using modern encryption standards such as AES, or its older cousin, DES.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Other ciphers such as arcfour and blowfish are possible to use, but are now discouraged in favor of AES, the modern standard. SSH uses <em>Public Key Infrastructure</em> (PKI) authentication to verify users&#39; identities.

It has since been ported to many modern operating systems including macOS, OpenBSD, and Cygwin on Windows.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> rsync&#39;s homepage is at rsync.samba.org, is currently open source, and is maintained on GitHub by Wayne Davidson. There&#39;s also an examples page, including sample bash scripts that use rsync as a backup tool.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> rsync can also be run in daemon (background) mode, which when running, allows the use of the &quot;rsync://&quot; protocol syntax in apps that support it.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> One of the most powerful uses of rsync is to make incremental backups of computers or disks at specified time intervals automatically. It not only knows to transfer only files that are new or changed, but it even knows which parts of files have changed, and only transfers the updated portions if possible.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> On macOS, rsync works from the command line in Terminal and generally uses SSH to connect and transfer files between networked computers.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> A typical rsync command consists of the command, followed by a space, then the file to be copied or updated, followed by the user name and server IP or name separated by the @ symbol, followed by a space, and then the remote file or folder location on the server to transfer the file or folder to.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> For example, <code>rsync /Users/i7/filename <a href="https://appleinsider.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="087d7b6d7a487a6d65677c6d60677b7c">[email protected]</a> :remote-filename</code> sends a file named &quot;filename&quot; in the i7 user&#39;s home folder on a Mac to the remote server &quot;remotehost&quot; using a username and the current SSH keys installed on the Mac. The remote host can be a server name, or an IP address.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> In most cases, the source file or folder is specified first in the command, with the destination at the end. When syncing files in the other direction - from a server to your local machine, use the same command but the with a reversed file syntax.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> To get the full syntax and options available for rsync in Terminal, type:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>man rsync</code> and press <strong>Return</strong> .</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><h2 data-anchor="installation" id="installation"> Installation</h2></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> To install rsync on macOS, use the Homebrew package manager formula in Terminal:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>brew install rsync</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> To keep rsync up-to-date in Homebrew, use the update command:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>brew update rsync</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> After installation completes, verify your rsync installation in Terminal by typing:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>which rsync</code> and pressing <strong>Return</strong> .</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> You should see:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>/usr/bin/rsync</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> You can see which version of rsync is installed on your Mac by typing:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>rsync -v</code> and pressing <strong>Return</strong> .</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> You should see something like:</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>rsync version 2.6.9 protocol version 29</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>Copyright (C) 1996-2006 by Andrew Tridgell, Wayne Davison, and others.</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p><http:></http:></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>Capabilities: 64-bit files, socketpairs, hard links, symlinks, batchfiles,</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> <code>inplace, IPv6, 64-bit system inums, 64-bit internal inums</code></p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> This is followed by more information and all of rsync&#39;s options printed to Terminal.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> There are several other rsync Homebrew formulae available including the handy <code>rsync-time-backup</code> .

You would then run the script every so often by using a timed UNIX cron job, or via a daemon that runs in the background.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> You could also write a backup script and then simply run it manually at will by dragging and dropping it on a Terminal window and pressing <strong>Return</strong> .</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> It&#39;s easy to specify files, folders, or entire volumes using the rsync syntax as the source parameter. You can use rsync to back up to another local volume, a networked server, or an internet server.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> There are also several third-party backup apps that rely on rsync, such as rclone.org and Grsync, which is a GUI front-end for rsync.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Using rsync as a backup mechanism makes backing up a breeze and it&#39;s smart enough to handle most backup details for you.</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> There&#39;s no more worrying about which files and folders changed, which files are new, and which ones to exclude in a backup because they haven&#39;t changed.</p></div><p></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 10:57:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-use-sftp-and-rsync-for-file-transfers-in-macos</guid><link/> https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-use-sftp-and-rsync-for-file-transfers-in-macos <author><![CDATA[Chip Loder]]></author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get 3 months of Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps for record low $29.99]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="col-sm-12"><div class="align-center"></div></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p> Creative souls and digital artists should be on high alert!
